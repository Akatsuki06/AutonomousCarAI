# **AutonomousCarAI**
## Description

Training a car to drive autonomously. A deep learning implementation of simple self driving car. The aim of the project is to train a car to drive in a game terrain by capturing the frames and the keys. Each frame has been converted to a *1x2700* numpy array corresponds to which there are keys *w,s,a,d*.

## Prerequisites

The python libraries used to capture frames is ***win32api*** which is only available on windows. So it cant run on linux. As an alteranative ***pyscreenshot*** can be used in linux but its extremly slow to capture frames ~ 10fps. ***Keras*** with tensorflow backend has been used to train the model.



## How it works?

 - Run the ***game.exe***, once the red screen with the note "Press Space" appears run ***main.py*** Let main.py know the location of the game. So don't press space unless it finds the game screen.
 - ***main.py*** will capture the location of the game and will ask whether to train, test or quit.
 - Choose an option:
**Training** use *w*, *a*, *s*, *d* to move the car on the road and press *q* to stop training. This will collect data and store to data/ folder. Once data has been collected, use run ***model.py*** to create a trained model for the self driving car in the *model/* folder. Now this model can be used for
**Testing** Testing here refers to driving. Once there is a trained model this option can be used. Just select the option and let the car drive itself to stop testing put the cursor on the opencv screen windows and press *esc*.
